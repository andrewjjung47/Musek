For music lovers who wants customized music based on their mood, taste, and occation, but tired of your music player randomly shuffling to the wrong music. This Android app analyzes your mood and location, provided by Muse headband and Estimote beacons, to always play what you want to hear. 

Muse headband analyzes user's brain waves to determine mindfulness and concentration levels. This further categorizes the user's state as one of relaxed, focused, alert, and excited. Our Musek app uses this knowledge to pick the right music or audio.
